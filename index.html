                <h2>Using a carousel or slider is no longer cool</h2>
                <p>Most the current websites include a slider: Several images that alternate, but do we do it because it is useful or just because it is a fad?</p>
            </div>

            <p>When you use an image carousel or a slider on your website, do you know why you do it?</p>
            <p>Most will say (and not without reason) that it is a standard, and that in a certain way being a convention automatically makes it a good choice, no matter the purpose of the website or the theme. So I invite you to be contrary, to not follow the herd and the mainstream, be hipsters of web design.</p>

                <h3>What do the experts say?</h3>

                <p>Experts who set style have a very clear opinion: This resource is not cool at all, it is old-fashioned.</p>

                    We have tested "rotating offers" many times and found that it is a poor way to present home content.

                <p><strong>It is true that a carousel allows you to put a lot of information in a prominent position,</strong> alternating it over time, displaying highly visual elements ... but Apple taught us that minimalism is cool, and we all know that Apple is the best.</p>

                <p>There are many ways to attract curiosity, and movement and information overdose are not always the best tool.</p>

                <p>If we look at the example of Asos, it uses a single main image with two well-differentiated Calls to Action that instantly attract attention.</p>

                <h3>The top two reasons not to use a carousel:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Movement attracts the eye:</strong> Long before black rim glasses, humans specialized in detecting movement, such as hunters or natural prey. In web design, it means that this carousel is powerfully drawing our attention every time it moves (without implying that we continue to pay attention to it once it stops) and distracting us from the rest and important elements of the page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Too many messages lose the effect:</strong> A mobile carousel can be interpreted as a banner, thus becoming ignored by the user. You won't consciously do it, you just won't see it. In addition, instead of focusing on a single value proposition, you divide it into several offers: A user of your page is less likely to find the valuable content in the carousel at a glance. Lastly, they are frantic. You are reading the information from one skip to the next. In the worst case, you can't even go back.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Criticisms from a usability standpoint:</h3>

                <p>Usability has always had some run-ins with moving headers. That's because designers and usability people in general tend to be cool guys who like to go against the grain.</p>

                <p>There are three main criticisms against the use of this resource from the usability viewpoint:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>In the first place, <strong>it favours making serious usability errors,</strong> such as continuing to move after user interaction, inability to stop the animation, too many slides, too small buttons, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>It defines the amount of information that it can provide us with.</strong> When forcing transitions, you cannot put texts or images that take more than a couple of seconds to interpret.</li>
                    <li><strong>You split the value proposition and force the user to do things.</strong> Not all the information is shown at a glance, you force the user to interact to discover it, or stay attentive to a fixed element.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Do you like to make beautiful websites, or websites that generate business?</h3>

                <p>A carousel can make sense on one page. The fact that there are objections from the usability or from the business standpoints does not mean that if you are a graphic designer and you have made a spectacular slider, it will not be fantastic in your web portfolio.</p>
                <p>But if your goal is conversion, in most cases you will get better results by opting for a static image.</p>

                    <figcaption>Platforms like Steam use sliders with more than 10 items. This is due to: A) Business pressures B) These platforms are not the web. The user stays longer and interacts more.</figcaption>
