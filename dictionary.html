                            <dd><p>An A / B Test consists of developing and launching two versions of the same item and measuring which one works better. It is a test that helps us to optimize an email marketing strategy or improve the effectiveness of a landing page.</p>
                            <p>If you have detected that your page is going through bad times, it is time to apply actions to improve your open rate and click-throughs.</p>

                                <p>A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a value, which is usually numerical (to be fully measurable) that shows whether a company or a person is meeting the objectives that were set at the beginning of a task, campaign or a specific period of time.</p>
                                <h3>What requirements must a good KPI meet?</h3>
                                <p>So that we can say that a <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> is well defined (like any type of objective) we should apply what is known as the SMART Criterion, that is, make sure that it is:</p>

                                <ul id="requirements">
                                    <li>Specific: our KPI must be identified with a specific aspect in order to be able to make an improvement comparison. The more specific you are, the easier it will be to measure.</li>
                                    <li>Measurable: of course, it must be measurable in order to assess progress.
                                    Attainable: This is key. A <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> that is not achievable will not generate anything beyond frustration.</li>
                                    <li>Realistic: this point is closely related to the KPI being achievable. We must be aware of the resources at our disposal to be able to exceed the <abbr title="Key Performance Indicator">KPI</abbr> before setting it as a goal.</li>
                                    <li>Time-frame: setting a dead-line will make us optimize our efforts and will create a history with which we can compare our progress.
                                    </li>

                                <p>The businesses of the 21st century coexist with an enormous amount of data. The problem is that these are both structured and unstructured: Welcome to the jungle! Big Data tries to make sense of that great mass of data, order it and study it to obtain ideas that lead to better business movements.</p>

                                <p>The Blockchain is a technology that allows the transfer of data in a completely secure way thanks to very sophisticated coding. It is usually compared to a company ledger where all money flows are recorded. Of course, in this case, we would be talking about a digital event book.</p>
                                <p>To talk about Blockchain is to talk about the technology (the information coding system) that is behind Bitcoin. However, its function goes further. It can also be used to create other cryptocurrencies that are based on the same principles, but that have other properties (policy, algorithm, etc.).</p>

                                <p>Bounce is the indicator that tells us the number of emails that could not be delivered to the recipient's inbox in an email marketing campaign.
                                </p>
                                <p>Within this indicator we find two types: Hard Bounce and Soft Bounce, but what are they and how are they different?</p>
                                <p>Hard Bounce and Soft Bounce are two of the most important metrics in email marketing since they will tell us if the bounce is due to a specific problem or because that email address no longer exists.</p>

                                <p>A <abbr title="Call to Action">CTA</abbr> (also called a call to action) is a button or link located on our site that seeks to attract potential customers and convert them into final customers, usually through a form on a landing page.</p>
                                <p>A <abbr title="Call to Action">CTA</abbr> is the link between the regular content that the user consumes and a page (landing page) with a more interesting offer for our user, which is relevant and interesting enough to persuade him to complete our form.</p>

                                <p>A chatbot is a computer program with which it is possible to have a conversation, whether we want to ask for some kind of information or to carry out an action.</p>
                                <p>An example. Nowadays, if you want to buy shoes through Asos, you have to access their website, find what you are looking for and buy it. But what if Asos had a bot? It would only be necessary to write a message to the brand through Facebook and tell it what we want. And even if we had doubts about the measurements of the sizes, we could consult our problem in a moment.</p>
